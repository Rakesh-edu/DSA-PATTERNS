************TWO POINTERS************
->Two pointer is mainly used to avoid checking all pairs.
->it reduces time complexit from O(n2) to O(n).
--->[If array is sorted → Two Pointers is my FIRST thought]
->applying condition based on problem description


COMMOM TEMPLATE FOR TWO POINTERS FOR CONTION CHECKING
