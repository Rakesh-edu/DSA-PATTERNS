brute force:checking over each and every substring and looking to hit the condition,which may take O(n2) time.
Optimized:
->we check length of every consecutive group of substring.
->we take the min(countof0s,countof1s) and add it answer every time

example:
s="00111"
    count0=2
    count1=3;
    no.of groups=min(count0,count1)=>min(2,3)

the substring should be either "0011" or "01"

code:
int countBinarySubstrings(string s) {
        int curr = 1;
        int prev = 0;
        int ans = 0;

        for(int i = 1; i < s.size(); i++) {
            if(s[i] == s[i-1]) {
                curr++;
            }
            else {
                ans += min(prev, curr);
                prev = curr;
                curr = 1;
            }
        }

        ans += min(prev, curr);
        return ans;
